# scalajs-google-charts
Type-safe and Scala-friendly facade-library over Google Charts

# Current version
0.2.1

# About 
I wanted to use Timeline Chart (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/timeline) 
for an ungoing project (https://github.com/kristoferB/SP), 
so I started implement it under googleTimeSeries branch.

Then I realised that somebody else also wanted to use Google Charts 
for their project so it would be nice to only add a libraryDependency!

I got much help from Corey Auger and his scalajs-google-maps library!
(see: https://github.com/coreyauger/scalajs-google-maps)

# Contribute
